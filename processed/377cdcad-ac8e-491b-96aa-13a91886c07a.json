  "description": "The mission of the Jim Collins Foundation (JCF) is to provide financial assistance to transgender people for gender-affirming surgeries. This foundation offers two grant options; The Founders' Grant which covers 100% of the surgical costs and The Krysallis Anne Hembrough Legacy Fund which covers 50% of surgical costs. The foundation aims to provide access to these vital surgeries for those who want it but due to prevalent discrimination against transgender people, such costs are usually impossible to meet.",
