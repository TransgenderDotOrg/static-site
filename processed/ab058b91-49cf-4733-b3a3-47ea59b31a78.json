  "description": "A Place for Marsha is one of many start-up projects aiming towards helping Trans individuals and families in increasingly dangerous states to a safer place. APFM began its journey in March of 2023 in reaction to the rise of anti-trans legislation around the nation. APFM now focuses on matching Refugees from red states as roommates, carefully handling one household at a time.",
