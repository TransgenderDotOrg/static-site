The clinic exists to serve the unique medical needs of Seattleâ€™s LGBTQ community, particularly targeting those who have significant distrust of the medical community due to prior experiences of judgment and discrimination. The aim of the clinic is to create a safe space where patients feel celebrated and healthy, by providing evidence-based and integrative medicine alongside open acceptance."
